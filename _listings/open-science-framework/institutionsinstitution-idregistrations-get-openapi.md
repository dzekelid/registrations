    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

    The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate users object.

    Registrations may be filtered by their  `id`, `title`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `category`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `contributors`, and `preprint`
