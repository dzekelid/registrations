      description: |-
        A paginated list of all registrations affiliated with an institution.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate users object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/cos/registrations?filter[title]=science.

        Registrations may be filtered by their  `id`, `title`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `category`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `contributors`, and `preprint`

  /nodes/{node_id}/draft_registrations/:
    get:
      summary: List all draft registrations
      description: |-
        A paginated list of all of the draft registrations of a given node.

        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that accompany a registration. A registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted, but can be withdrawn.

        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may view draft registrations.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 draft registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate draft registration object and contains the full representation of the draft registration, meaning additional requests to a draft registration's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).
